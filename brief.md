Context to the Customer Centricity Project 

The opportunity: At key touchpoints - NPS surveys, client interviews, and closed-lost reviews feedback was fragmented, inconsistently captured, and rarely translated into actionable insight.  

As a result, valuable client feedback was underused, creating missed opportunities to strengthen relationships, respond faster, and embed learning into how the business works, sells, and improves. 

 

Our role to date: We have been streamlining and simplifying Korn Ferry’s approach by creating clear processes, templates, and reporting structures, and we continue to support the ongoing analysis of NPS survey results, NPS interview feedback, and closed-lost feedback to surface actionable insights that drive change across the business.  

 

 

What we want to do next – specifically focused on the NPS Interview workflow 

The next phase of work is focused on improving how NPS interview insight is captured, explored and used. We want to build some sort of interactive platform that brings together 

NPS interview transcripts 

The structured reports generated from those interviews 

(at a later point) NPS survey responses, so survey feedback can be layered into analysis 

 

 

Current NPS Interview process 

As part of the Customer Centricity project, we conduct NPS interviews with clients who opt in at the end of the NPS survey 

 

Current workflow 

Conduct interview 

Generate a structured report from the interview transcript 

Share the report with account leads 

 

On a monthly basis, we also produce theme analysis from the interviews, focusing on: 

What clients value and why they choose Korn Ferry 

The promoter experience 

Where the experience falls short 

 

We also pull positive quotes for internal use. These may reflect: 

Overall positive experience 

Specific consultants or moments 

Each quote is labelled with: company name, account type, solution, region, NPS 

 

Segments used in analysis 

Regions: NA, EMEA, APAC, LATAM 

Solutions: Executive Search, Professional Search, Consulting 

NPS: Promoters, Passives, Detractors 

Time: monthly data since August 2025 

 

 

What the platform needs to do 

Objective: Unlock value from customer feedback by bringing it into an interactive platform that makes insight visible and relevant to each consultant, encourages engagement with the data, and enables action to improve client engagements over time - supporting our promise to Be More Than. 

 

To support this objective, we are open to thoughtful suggestions on other ways leaders and consultants could interact with the data or have insight surfaced to them - where this clearly increases engagement, understanding, and action 

 

Content and management 

Hosts all NPS interview transcripts and their structured reports 

Allows us to continue adding new transcripts and reports over time 

(at a later date) support automated generation of structured reports from transcripts 

 

Visibility & filtering 

Shows: 

total number of interviews completed to date 

breakdowns by region, solution, NPS category, and other segments 

 

Provides: 

a list view of transcripts 

key takeaways per interview, evidenced by quotes 

a link to download the structured report 

 

Allows filtering by: 

region 

solution 

NPS category 

month or quarter (e.g. Q2: Aug, Sep, Oct, or a specific month) 

 

Insight & themes 

Surfaces views on: 

why clients choose Korn Ferry 

promoter experience 

where the experience falls short 

any additional themes that can be credibly surfaced 

 

Displays direct client quotes, clearly labelled with the correct metadata 

 

Supports exploration of how themes change over time 

 

Exploration & querying 

Includes a chat or query capability so users can: 

ask questions about brand, marketing, or experience, for example 

find specific types of quotes or feedback 

 

Surfacing opportunities and follow-up actions 

Within interview transcripts and structured reports, clients sometimes reference: 

future needs or potential areas of support 

opportunities to deepen or expand the relationship 

actions that would prompt re-engagement or strengthen the partnership 

 

The platform should support the ability to surface these opportunity- and action-oriented insights so they can be easily identified, explored and actioned. 

 

Future enhancement 

At a later point, layer in NPS survey response data (open ended feedback) so it can: 

contribute to theme analysis 

allow survey and interview insight to be explored together 

 

 

Data to upload 

 

Interview transcripts and structured reports 

The platform will initially be populated with: 

NPS interview transcripts 

the structured reports generated from those interviews 

a supporting spreadsheet containing interview metadata (e.g. client name, company name, interview ID) 

 

Each transcript and report follows a consistent naming convention, which encodes the key attributes required for segmentation and analysis. The platform will need to be able to read and interpret this structure in order to correctly ingest, organise, and surface the data. 

 

Transcript naming format (example): 
T29_NPS10_NA_CONSULTING_HOUSE_DEC25 

T = Transcript 

29 = Interview ID (linked to the supporting spreadsheet) 

NPS10 = Net Promoter Score 

NA = Region 

CONSULTING = Solution 

HOUSE = Account type (e.g. Diamond, Regional, Marquee) 

DEC25 = Month and year 

 

Report naming format (example): 
R29_NPS10_NA_CONSULTING_HOUSE_DEC25 

R = Structured report 

All remaining fields mirror the transcript naming 

 

This naming convention reflects how data is currently stored and should be treated as the initial input structure for this phase.  

 

 

Structured interview reports (reference and future use) 

The structured interview report format is included to: 

show the structure and level of detail currently being produced and uploaded into the platform 

provide a reference structure for future consideration, should we look to automate report generation from transcripts 

 

For this phase, reports will be uploaded as completed outputs. The structure is provided as context and a future target, not a delivery requirement at this stage.
