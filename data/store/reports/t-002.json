  "project": "Executive Search",
  "score": 10,
  "overview": "Vanessa, HR Director for Benelux region at Heidelberg Materials, had an extremely positive experience with CompanyA for a confidential procurement director search. The engagement was her first with CompanyA in her current role, though she had worked with consultant OT previously. The search was highly confidential as the previous procurement director was still in place. CompanyA was selected over two other consultancies based on their approach to guaranteeing confidentiality and the trust relationship with OT. The process resulted in three excellent candidates, all of whom met with the general manager - an unprecedented outcome. The selected candidate (Anne) has started in the role.",
  "whatWentWell": [
    "CompanyA's approach to confidentiality was exceptional - they provided detailed arguments and references for handling confidential searches, which was critical in Belgium's small market",
    "The intake conversation and profile definition process was thorough - CompanyA created the profile description and used LinkedIn profiles to help narrow down requirements",
    "Assessment tools were included in the package and provided valuable insights - the assessment reports (2-3 pages) matched what Vanessa observed in interviews",
    "Quality of candidates was outstanding - all three final candidates were excellent and could do the job, matching company culture perfectly",
    "Reactivity and adaptability - CompanyA quickly adjusted when feedback was given about report timing (needed 3-4 business days before interviews instead of 48 hours)",
    "Handled last-minute interview changes smoothly and transparently",
    "Support during offer stage - helped explain the total compensation package to the candidate, including special bonus system",
    "Client-oriented and service-oriented approach throughout",
    "The consultant OT's previous relationship and trust was a key factor in selection"
  ],
  "challengesPainPoints": [
    "Initial candidate reports were sent only 48 hours before interviews (Friday evening for Monday morning interview) - too short notice for thorough preparation",
    "Some information was missing from initial reports, though CompanyA was reactive in adding it for subsequent reports",
    "Fees are higher than other headhunters in Belgium - limiting use to Exco level positions only",
    "No follow-up yet with the placed candidate (Anne) - Vanessa hopes for follow-up calls at a few weeks, 3 months, and 6 months to get candid feedback"
  ],
  "gapsIdentified": [
    "Follow-up process with placed candidates - Vanessa explicitly requested follow-up calls with Anne to gather feedback that the candidate might not share directly with her",
    "Timing of candidate reports - initial reports arrived too late for proper preparation, though this was addressed after feedback",
    "Compensation negotiation involvement - Vanessa preferred to handle this herself due to potential conflict of interest (fees based on salary percentage), though CompanyA did provide salary expectations and post-offer support"
  ],
  "keyThemes": [
    "Confidentiality and trust are paramount in small markets like Belgium",
    "Quality over quantity - three excellent candidates is better than many mediocre ones",
    "Reactivity and adaptability to client feedback is highly valued",
    "Relationship and trust with specific consultants drives selection decisions",
    "Assessment tools add value when properly integrated and explained",
    "Client service orientation and being treated as a valued client throughout the process",
    "Cost considerations limit broader use - only for Exco level positions",
    "Follow-up and ongoing relationship management after placement is desired"
  ],
  "actionsRecommendations": [
    "Establish standard practice of sending candidate reports 3-4 business days before interviews to allow proper preparation time",
    "Implement structured follow-up process with placed candidates at key milestones (few weeks, 3 months, 6 months) to gather feedback and ensure successful integration",
    "Consider fee structure flexibility for non-Exco positions to expand market opportunity in Belgium",
    "Continue emphasizing confidentiality approach in pitches for sensitive searches",
    "Maintain the reactive and adaptable approach that allows for quick course correction based on client feedback",
    "Ensure all required information is included in initial candidate reports to avoid back-and-forth",
    "Leverage assessment tools more prominently as a differentiator, especially when they align well with candidate observations"
  ],
  "additionalInsight": "Vanessa compared this experience favorably to a concurrent search with a legal-specialized headhunter that was 'a mess' and she would never use again. She explicitly stated she would use CompanyA for the legal director search if it were Exco level. The contrast highlights the value of CompanyA's approach. Vanessa also noted that CompanyA's core business should remain executive search - she has existing partnerships for leadership development and internal expertise for other HR projects, so expansion into consultancy services is not of interest to her."
