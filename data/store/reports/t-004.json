  "interviewDate": "2025-12-01",
  "project": "Executive Search",
  "score": 6,
  "overview": "Jeanette, Chief People Officer at Ocorian, had a challenging experience with CompanyA for two concurrent searches (Chief Digital Officer and Group Capability Centers Head). The process took 5-6 months instead of the expected 2-3 months. Key issues included difficulty getting a mixed slate of candidates (especially women), all-male consultant team, significant problems with compensation information and negotiation, and inefficient communication. Despite eventually finding two good candidates, the experience left Jeanette and CEO Chantelle frustrated, particularly with the lack of pace, urgency, and assertiveness from CompanyA. The compensation issues nearly caused them to lose a preferred candidate.",
  "whatWentWell": [
    "Eventually found two very good candidates for both roles",
    "Consultants were personable and professional",
    "CompanyA did negotiate on behalf of candidates",
    "Stuart (CompanyA) reached out for follow-up meeting after feedback was provided",
    "The process started reasonably well initially"
  ],
  "challengesPainPoints": [
    "Diversity in candidate slate - had to repeatedly request women candidates; all consultants were male, making it harder to attract female candidates",
    "Compensation information was extremely difficult to obtain - couldn't get current compensation details until offer stage, requiring constant back-and-forth",
    "Compensation details were vague - didn't understand structure of bonuses, equity, fixed vs variable components, requiring multiple rounds of questions",
    "Process took 5-6 months instead of expected 2-3 months - way longer than anticipated",
    "Reports arrived too late - often landing 1-2 hours before calls with 7 new CVs, making preparation impossible",
    "Lack of pace and urgency - didn't match the CEO's high-energy, fast-moving style",
    "Lack of assertiveness - consultants were hesitant, didn't proactively recommend top candidates, required client to drive conversations",
    "Candidates didn't meet brief initially - took 2+ months before right candidates emerged, and CompanyA didn't proactively identify the mismatch",
    "Nearly lost preferred candidate due to compensation delays - candidate had another offer while CompanyA was still gathering compensation details",
    "Didn't end up with originally preferred candidate - offer wasn't competitive enough due to delays, though they got a better candidate in the end",
    "No benchmarking support - CompanyA provided vague expectations but no detailed compensation benchmarking or structure guidance",
    "Inefficient communication - constant back-and-forth on compensation, didn't proactively manage the process",
    "CEO had to take over negotiations - Chantelle ended up calling candidate directly to move things along"
  ],
  "gapsIdentified": [
    "Diversity and inclusion - lack of female consultants impacts ability to attract and identify female candidates; need for more diverse consultant team",
    "Compensation expertise - lack of detailed understanding of compensation structures, inability to provide clear benchmarking, delays in gathering compensation information",
    "Project management and communication - reports arrive too late, inefficient communication, lack of proactive management",
    "Assertiveness and pace - consultants too hesitant, don't match high-energy client expectations, need to be more proactive in recommendations",
    "Brief alignment - didn't proactively identify when candidates weren't matching brief, required client to initiate course correction conversations",
    "Timeline management - unable to meet aggressive timelines (2-3 months), process extended to 5-6 months",
    "Stakeholder management - didn't effectively manage high-energy CEO who expects assertive, fast-moving partners"
  ],
  "keyThemes": [
    "Diversity matters - all-male consultant team creates barriers to diverse candidate slates",
    "Compensation expertise is critical - detailed understanding of compensation structures is essential for senior roles",
    "Pace and urgency must match client expectations - high-energy clients need assertive, fast-moving partners",
    "Proactive communication and project management - clients expect consultants to drive the process, not the other way around",
    "Timeline management - ability to meet aggressive timelines is a key differentiator",
    "Assertiveness in recommendations - clients want consultants to recommend top candidates, not just present options",
    "Brief alignment - consultants should proactively identify and address misalignment with client requirements",
    "Compensation negotiation support - detailed compensation information must be gathered early and presented clearly"
  ],
  "actionsRecommendations": [
    "Improve diversity in consultant teams - recruit and deploy more female consultants, especially for roles requiring diverse candidate slates",
    "Enhance compensation expertise - train consultants on compensation structures, develop better benchmarking capabilities, gather compensation information early in process",
    "Improve project management - send reports well in advance of calls (at least 2-3 business days), proactively manage timelines, provide clear recommendations",
    "Increase assertiveness and pace - match high-energy client expectations, proactively recommend top candidates, drive conversations rather than waiting for client direction",
    "Proactive brief alignment - regularly check in on brief alignment, proactively identify when candidates don't match requirements, initiate course correction conversations",
    "Better stakeholder management - understand client communication styles and energy levels, adapt approach accordingly",
    "Compensation process improvement - gather detailed compensation information early, provide clear structure breakdowns, support benchmarking and negotiation more effectively",
    "Timeline management - set realistic expectations, but also develop capability to meet aggressive timelines when required",
    "Follow-up and relationship repair - continue outreach efforts (like Stuart's), use feedback to improve future engagements"
  ],
  "additionalInsight": "Jeanette noted that this experience was worse than her previous experiences with CompanyA (different team), but she didn't have concerns when Chantelle said they were using CompanyA based on reputation and past experience. The frustration built over time, with the worst issues occurring at the end during compensation negotiations. Jeanette is open to future engagements if improvements are made. The contrast with her experience of 'better headhunters' highlights the importance of pace, assertiveness, and compensation expertise. The fact that they eventually got good candidates shows the underlying capability exists, but the execution and process management need significant improvement."
