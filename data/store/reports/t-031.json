  "overview": "Philippe is the HR Manager for EMEA at Avanos Headquarters, responsible\nfor all hiring across the region. This was their first time working with Korn\nFerry, but they already knew Olivier personally from previous experience in\nexecutive search. They engaged Korn Ferry for a silent search for a senior\ninternational finance role.\nThe overall experience was very positive: strong alignment, high-quality\ncandidates, transparent communication, effective collaboration with\nresearchers, and smooth end-to-end execution. Philippe expressed high\ntrust in Olivier’s ethics and professionalism, felt the partnership worked\nefficiently, and stated clearly they would choose him/Korn Ferry again\nwithout benchmarking alternatives.\nNo improvement areas were identified by the interviewee.\nWhat Went Well",
  "whatWentWell": [
    "Trusted prior relationship enabled fast alignment Philippe had worked with Olivier previously and trusted his professionalism and ethics. \"Knowing his level of ethics and professionalism, I was quite confident that we could find common grounds... and find a suitable candidate.\" \"He learned me a lot in the executive search market.\" Clear, efficient communication and ways of working They shared a similar professional background and \"spoke the same language,\" making the process smooth. \"It was quite easy to pass through a clear briefing... because I was prepared for it.\" \"It was like really an easy way of interacting... to be efficient and to go forward.\" Early involvement of the researcher supported quality and consistency Philippe valued this as it preserved accuracy of the brief. \"He involved his researchers straight away... otherwise you always lose some essence about it.\" Strong understanding of the organisation and brief Candidate fit and organisational alignment were strong from the outset. \"The long list of candidates they presented... for 60 to 70% was spot on.\" \"They did a very, very good job.\" Respect for urgency and sensitivity of a silent search The team responded well to changing internal conditions and demonstrated resilience. \"The urgency linked to the search was also respected... results came out in quite a short amount of time.\" \"He was also quite resilient, properly following up... without being pushy.\" Transparent and pragmatic role-shaping discussions Olivier provided market insight and helped calibrate scope, expectations and trade-offs. \"It was always an open discussion... finding common grounds.\" \"If you want all of this, it's going to cost you way more.\"",
    "Detailed and useful compensation insights Philippe appreciated structured salary breakdowns for each candidate. \"They were crystal clear... a complete drill down about the salary package.\" Strong pipeline management and high-quality candidate materials The process included touchpoints, longlist reviews, a structured one-pager per candidate and strong scheduling. \"They straight away corrected where needed.\" \"The PowerPoint was built quite well... one pager with matching points, attention points, notice period, non-compete, salary.\"",
    "Seamless coordination and communication with the wider team Scheduling and handovers were consistent and error-free. \"It was impeccable... never a breach of information.\"",
    "Clear intention to work with Korn Ferry again Philippe is unlikely to use other firms for future executive searches. \"Definitely no brainer... I wouldn't even benchmark.\" \"He managed to prove that... he took that also to Korn Ferry and even polished it more.\" Challenges/ Pain Points"

  ],
  "actionsRecommendations": [
    "Because the interviewee expressed no dissatisfaction or improvement areas, the only actionable recommendations - strictly grounded in their feedback - relate to reinforcing behaviours that worked well: • Maintain early involvement of researchers to ensure brief accuracy and minimise information loss. • Continue transparent communication and non-pushy follow-up, which Philippe highly valued. • Preserve the structured candidate materials (one-pager, matching points, salary breakdown) as these supported efficient decision-making. • Maintain the partnership-led approach, which was central to Philippe's positive experience."
