  "whatWentWell": [
    "Tim reported a consistently strong end-to-end experience throughout the search process. The team was described as easy to work with and highly aligned to the organisation's needs: \"They absolutely understood the brief, really fully targeted exactly the right people, put a great long list together, managed the candidates really, really well.\"",
    "Communication and accessibility were highlighted positively: \"We had one scheduled weekly call throughout the process... and they were always available for other queries, more ad hoc stuff.\" The search outcome met expectations fully: \"Oh, 100%.",
    "Absolutely. Thoroughly enjoyed working with them.\"",
    "Administrative and logistical support was noted as a particular strength: \"Their admin support was excellent... all the logistical arrangements for the interviews and lunches and all the rest of it... it was just first class, all the way through.\" Challenges/ Pain Points"
  ],
  "challengesPainPoints": [
    "No material challenges or pain points were raised during the interview. Tim explicitly noted the absence of issues: \"It was one of the most seamless processes I've ever been through. No, there isn't a lot.\"",
    "Gaps Identified (raised by Tim) No gaps were explicitly identified by Tim in relation to the search engagement. While Tim noted that broader consulting support may require greater organisational scale, this was framed as contextual rather than a shortcoming: \"I think we'd need a bit more scale before we went to somebody of Korn Ferry size to do other work like that.\" Key Themes"

  "keyThemes": [
    "Strong relationship and trust-based working model. Tim emphasised the importance of comfort, trust, and ease of working with the search team over an extended period: \"You spend a lot of time working with the search... it's about how comfortable you feel with them.\"",

Korn Ferry was perceived as quickly grasping the distinct nature of the organisation and tailoring the search accordingly: \"They understood that we are a membership organisation that lobbies on behalf of our members... they had the right people in the room.\"",
    "Effective use of assessment tools. Psychometric assessment tools were viewed as a meaningful value add and are intended to be used beyond hiring: \"We use their psychometric tools for assessment, and they were very, very good.\". \"It will be used for a development plan, yeah, absolutely.\"",
    "High-quality consulting capability beyond search (when used). Past experiences with assessment interpretation and remuneration consulting were described positively: \"The psychologists... were absolutely first class... she did it brilliantly, absolutely, really clearly.\" Actions & Recommendations"
