The\nrelationship spans approximately three years and covers four cohorts of a\nnine-month cluster talent programme involving facilitated modules, peer\ncoaching, project work, and mentoring.\nClaire described the relationship as highly collaborative and embedded,\nwith Korn Ferry facilitators perceived as an extension of the internal talent\nfunction. No material challenges or pain points were raised, and feedback\nthroughout was consistently positive.\nWhat Went Well",
  "whatWentWell": [
    "Embedded partnership and ease of collaboration. Claire repeatedly described Korn Ferry as feeling like part of the internal team rather than an external provider: \"It's just so easy, really, like, they're just part of our own ASML talent organization, so in that sense, you don't notice that Korn Ferry is a different organization.\"",
    "Strong communication and flexibility. Communication was highlighted as a central strength of the working relationship: \"Communication. It's everything, you know, the communication... it always goes smoothly, flexible, open for new ideas.\"",
    "Psychological safety and facilitation quality. The facilitators were praised for their ability to create a safe and open learning environment quickly, even among participants who did not know each other: \"From the moment they enter, you know, the new candidates enter the room, there is already a sort of safe space.\"",
    "Feedback delivery was described as both challenging and supportive: \"They're critical, of course, because that's also their role, but at the same time, in such a loving way.\"",
    "Positive participant feedback across cohorts. Although no formal survey is used, Claire conducts structured face-to-face feedback sessions after each cohort and reported consistently positive responses: \"All the feedback is always really positive.\" Challenges/ Pain Points"

Claire\nhighlighted the ability to refine the programme cohort by cohort as a\ndifferentiator, enabled by the programme’s cluster-level ownership: “After\nevery cohort, we can tweak a little bit to make every cohort a better\nprogram.”\nAnticipated organisational transformation context. Claire noted that a\nbroader organisational transformation is expected in the coming year,\nalthough details are currently limited: “It will be a culture change… but we\nall don’t know what it is.”"
