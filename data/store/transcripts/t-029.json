So I was looking for somebody who could move this along and and being a board of one blood, there's so many different professionals. So they were looking for all different types of leaders, which, like she wanted somebody wanted somebody from lab Corp. So different people wanted different things, they were able to perform that task extremely well. And we ended up picking our CEO who started present, CEO who starts November 17, great."

      "speaker": "Interviewer 1:30",
      "text": "So the quality of the candidates and having options that was important, very important to us.

      "speaker": "Speaker 1 1:52",
      "text": "or both? I think it's both. I think it was a combination of both. First of all, I think she understood our business quite well. And then I think she understood the outside businesses that would fit into this business. So I think it was a combination of both,"

      "speaker": "Interviewer 2:09",

But so and then we did three live here, about in my office, about three weeks ago, and and then we went through the negotiations of what they needed to bring them on board. It all just worked out perfectly for us. So"

      "text": "plan? Yes, they did, yes, they did. So we wanted to pay less. So we wanted to pay at the 50 quartile instead of the 75th so it brought down the salary, but 200 grand. So we wanted people to know that up front. And also, too, they towers in Watson was kind of comparing them to hospitals, and basically, Blood Center is not a hospital, so we asked them to redo it, but Jenna was very good at being involved. And with all those conversations, including, you know, how much we're going to pay for housing and health insurance benefits. What goes into the 401 K so yes, they were totally involved with the whole process, great."

      "speaker": "Speaker 1 3:58",
      "text": "Well, they they jumped in and kind of helped parlay it into their system. So they have a whole different system where then they start looking at certain skill sets and things like that. They had us all do a survey and what we were looking for so that Tid into the job description. So I think we were looking at more than just a job description, but skill sets, because one of the people was lab core. One was like a hedge fund guy. Two were from the blood banking, so it was what we were looking for. You know, it was different skill sets, because you could take those skill sets and run a blood center."

      "speaker": "Speaker 1 4:44",
      "text": "I don't think so. I don't think anything I would want anything different. If the CEO left again, would I pick her again in a second? So I don't think they could need to do anything differently. I think they figured out their magic, and they need to stick with it."

There it was about one $80 million dollar. They put out about 9 million a year and on the grants. But just they, their tools that they were using were beyond the tools that but we chose to use -- 2 of 4 -- one who knew this market. But the tools are different. It was totally different. You get the same outcome at the end. But the tools, they had a higher skill set with the tools I think that they utilize."

    {
      "speaker": "Speaker 1 5:51",
      "text": "The value is is you're getting input from an entire board. So I think, you know, it's a great way to get feedback and and listen to because, you know, we I didn't want to pick the person myself. I wanted everybody to pick we just wanted to line it up. And I think the tools help understand the skill set, credentials, understanding of the business. You know, blood banking is going to take a sharp turn, going the other way because of all the cuts going on. So we needed to to make sure everybody understood that. You know what I mean, the hospitals are going to get clipped. Medicare is getting clipped. The HCA is getting clipped over here. So first thing they go look at is all the ancillary services, which is blood and so so they it was good to have every it's a good way to get everybody to offer feedback and input into the process. I think."

So that's what you look for when you're when you're doing something like this. So, you know, it was, it was very transparent. I mean, we were on a schedule. We did zoom calls, everything moved. I mean, I'm kind of like a real aa personality. So see if fit in perfectly with my style. We kept it moving and think about it. We got to you. We decided what in, like April, and we're done.
