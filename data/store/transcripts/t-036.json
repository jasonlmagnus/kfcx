      "text": "We interviewed a number of search firms. Korn Ferry was already very familiar with our institution, because they had helped us with salary surveys and market analyzes, and they'd helped us actually develop the job description, because the post of CEO was relatively new for the for the museum, and so we'd been working with them on and off for two or three years In setting all of that up, but we still interviewed a number of other search firms for that particular project, and ultimately came back to Korn Ferry because I think they had a better understanding of what we were looking for, which in our case was a little different than the usual museum director a number of the firms that we interviewed said, Yeah, we hear what you're saying, but what you really want us to look for is a museum director. And we said, No, that's not what we want you to look for. We want you to look for a CEO. And here's the job description. It's not that of a museum director. And yet, they kept sort of pushing us towards it felt like they were trying to push our square peg in their round hole, rather than tailor the search to what we really wanted. So that's why we chose Korn Ferry, great."

I was only engaged in one of those search processes, but this was was smoother, more collegial, more productive. And I'm not sure if it was the specific team that we were working at at Korn Ferry that that were that compatible with, with our search committee, or whether it was the timing of things the last two times that the museum did a search with Korn Ferry, the museum was not in a great position. So the pool of applicants was a little disappointing, and this time around, it was a much more robust pool of applicants. They seemed better chosen, better filtered, if you will, or selected from a broader pool by Korn Ferry to meet what we thought we needed."

I think any if, if there had been any more candidates, the process would have taken vastly longer, and I'm not sure that it would have gotten us any further than we then we got with the pool that that Korn Ferry started with, but my sense was that they looked over about 100 applications, and they brought about 30 to us to look over, and we filtered the or condensed that to a pool of 11 for interviews, and then a short list of seven, and then a short, short list of four. And that, frankly, that was plenty."

We had a zoom call every other week, and regular emails and and data sharing that way, I will say that that once we hit our stride, it was, it was very smooth and a predictable cadence and and so forth. Early on, it was a little confusing, because there were several different people at Korn Ferry reaching out to the search committee, and so we'd all have a recollection of having gotten an email from someone, but we couldn't search for it easily, and ultimately having having shared that, that minor point of frustration, they made sure that all the communications came from the same the same email address, so it was easy for us to sort them and and find them days later or weeks later."

It's as if they've done a K, 4d k, f, 4d on the organization,"

      "speaker": "Interviewer 17:18",
      "text": "helped make the choice, Yeah, makes sense in terms of, I suppose, moving forward, if you're doing a search again, or even in this experience, how did you at any point prioritize or think that they should be leading more into the use of Tech? So whether it's to kind of filter out candidates, is that important to you, or is it more about the individual view and network?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Interviewer 18:23",
      "text": "And then again, going back to your your role as sitting on the board where, if you're happy to share how much of the challenges that you face as a, as a, as a business at the moment are around people, whether it's people skills or inability to kind of find the right people, or AI versus people, is that something that comes up a lot,"

So if, if you're the head of communications, you're also crafting much of the marketing, and you're also, I don't know, I guess, I guess. What I'm trying to say -- 3 of 4 -- is finding the right people who have the skill sets and the bandwidth to be able to cover lots of different roles is hard"
