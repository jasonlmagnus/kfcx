      "text": "Just to introduce myself, I'm managing partner at growth consultancy, so we've been supporting Korn Ferry for five or six years, so we know their business well, and they've asked us to run these interviews as agnostic third party, just to encourage you to speak more freely, just quickly as well. I've got my note taker in here so it can help me write up the report. Is that all right with you? Claire 1:59 That's fine, yeah, of course."

      "text": "Okay, great. I'll try not to keep you for the whole half an hour. I appreciate you're busy so if we jump straight in, if you could just explain your role in the business and the relationship that you have with Korn Ferry Claire 2:18 yes, of course. So I'm working now for three years for ASML. When I started at ASML, l already started with the it's called cluster talents program. So I'm an HR business partner. I have two departments in the cluster, machine conditioning. Machine conditioning is a cluster within B and E, which is the biggest, let's say business unit, of ASML that contains 14,000 people. And that sub cluster, that cluster within B and E contains 800 colleagues, and every year we run a cluster talent program where around 20 young talents are nominated to join this this program, and then it runs for about nine months. And my role in here is, I'm sort of the program manager. It's not an official ASML talent program. We have 'acop', and because there were limited seats within ASML, we decided to, yeah, also organize a talent program for the specific cluster. I have someone from learning who's just, you know, planning the locations, the dates, etc, inviting everyone. And for me, it's more coordinating the whole program. So if I want to change something, I check that with the cluster head of machine conditioning, and with my colleague from HR. So that's a little bit my role. I have some freedom in this, in this program, which is super nice. So you know this is now cohort four that we're having with Korn Ferry and after every cohort, we have a feedback session with all the candidates. And the great thing is that, because it's so flexible and it's not big changes, because it's not an ASML program, but just focus on the cluster manually program manager every cohort, we can tweak a little bit to make every cohort a better program. So that's really great and amazing to do."

      "speaker": "Interviewer 4:37",
      "text": "And so have you been working with Korn Ferry since the beginning. Claire 4:42 Yeah, my colleague, they created, let's say, or that's not also, sorry, we have another cluster within ASML that's called 'mdev'. I don't know the whole, let's say, what is it wording? they started first with this cluster talent program and Korn Ferry, and we sort of stole it from them, because we saw what a great initiative it was. So that's how we started. So I think 'mdev' really started to build the program with Korn Ferry, and we sort of took everything from the four modules, but we tweaked it around our cluster. So if we organize separate workshops, they're focused on machine conditioning, and 'mdev' does the same for their cluster. So I only joined at the end of Cohort One."

      "speaker": "Interviewer 5:37",
      "text": "Okay, fantastic. And, and how has your experience been working with the Korn Ferry team on this? Claire 5:44 -- 1 of 3 -- Yeah, amazing. I mean, in the beginning it was Fleur and Richard. I don't know if the name says anything to you, but those were the facilitators less trainings of Korn Ferry. I always tried to join the first module. They have four modules in two days, and I joined the first day. Not that I haven't facilitator co facilitator role, but it's just, you know, to also connect with all the talents, to connect with Fleur and Richard, okay, what is going on? How is the group working together? Is there anything that I need to know from an HR business perspective, also for ASML, yeah, it's just so easy, really, like, they're just part of our own, ASML talent organization, so in that sense, you don't notice that Korn Ferry is a different organization."

    {
      "speaker": "Interviewer 6:33",
      "text": "Brilliant, no, and what makes it good? Is it about their reactivity? Is it about their partnership? Claire 6:42 Communication. It's everything you know, the communication. I mean, if we pre discuss, for example, the kickoff, it always goes smoothly, flexible, open for new ideas. But also, yeah, well, we said it's not only when I have feedback sessions with them, but we also have, in the fourth module on day two, we have, with all the whole management layer, we have a sort of feedback evaluation sessions where all the candidates present, if you see how much they think. Now, it's not Fleur and Richard anymore, but it's Fleur and Matt. In the meantime, that changed, yeah, let's say they love, really Fleur and what the feedback is so amazing, yeah, that they from the moment they enter, you know, the new candidates enter the room, there is already a sort of safe space. And everybody opens up, even though it's module one, nobody knows really each other, there's immediately a safe space, yeah, and they take the group along in this in this journey, they're critical, of course, because that's also their role, but at the same time, in such a loving way that it's, you know, that also the feedback they're Giving, it's just accepted and really helpful for the candidates. Fantastic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Interviewer 8:05",
      "text": "Yeah, and do the candidates? I mean, at the end of each cohort, do they give feedback? Do you do surveys to get feedback from the from the participants, Claire 8:15 not directly a survey, but I always plan one and a half, two hours with them, face to face to go through, because it's not only, of course, the four modules, they also have a project they work on for nine months. It's different workshop, it's peer coaching. They have a mentor. So we go through all the different elements that CTP exists of, and then we discuss the feedback. But all the feedback is always really positive. Yes, that's why it also makes so fun for me to work on this this program."

    {
      "speaker": "Interviewer 8:46",
      "text": "Is there anything they could do better? I mean, anything at all, Claire 8:53 to be honest? No, really, no. That's also what I think I said in the feedback form that I provided earlier. No, no, no, sorry, no,"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Interviewer 9:03",
      "text": "that's okay. Did you ever work with any other providers? I mean, I know it was before your time when they got selected, but how did they compare to other consultancies that you work with? Claire 9:15 No, I've never worked with a consultancy or firms before like this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Interviewer 9:20",
      "text": "No, okay, no. And in terms of Korn Ferry, kind of in their broader perspective, how aware were you of Korn Ferry and what they do before you started working with them? Claire 9:33 -- 2 of 3 -- I worked at Canon from the cameras for over, I don't know, more than 10 years, and when I was working in 'umsofane', that was the operational head office of EMEA. I was also in contact with the strategic head office there. They implemented our talent management vision within canon. So they they completely did that with Korn Ferry. So that's when I was from. I never worked with them myself, because I was a complete team working on this, yeah, this talent program, but I rolled it out in 'umsofane'. So that's why I was, yeah, familiar, aware of Korn Ferry."

      "speaker": "Interviewer 10:13",
      "text": "And in terms of, from a broader perspective as a brand, is there anything that they could do better for you, or more engagement from you to kind of help you in your role, or even just kind of peer to peer, networking or events. Would that be something you'd be interested in? Claire 10:30 I would be interested. But for example, I regularly am on LinkedIn. I never see them in my feeds. Could also be my algorithm? But that's where I always check, you know, events, or even where I can seek help on an HR request. But I've never seen them there being active, and I also don't know, to be honest, I've never searched for them on their website to seek for. I don't know what they could do for me as an organization, so maybe that could be a more active LinkedIn approach."

Claire 11:31 At ASML, we have quite a transformation program on the agenda, but I have no clue what it will be. It will be a culture change. It will be something, but we all don't know what it is. It's only a few people within the whole of the company that know what will be going on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Interviewer 11:47",
      "text": "Yeah, well, it's the nature of transformation. Most people don't know what's going on. Claire 11:52 No, no, it will be announced somewhere next year. I don't know when half year, but, yeah."

      "speaker": "Interviewer 11:59",
      "text": "I mean, I think that's it. I mean, I think that's, you know, that was really helpful and really good to get kind of very specific feedback on the individuals. Claire 12:07 We also have always a feedback session afterwards. Also with my colleague from 'mdev' we had a feedback session at the end of cohort three together to see where we can improve and also align more. It always goes so smoothly. So sorry, not really feedback that you say, Okay, it's just going really well."
