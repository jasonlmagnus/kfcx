      "text": "So just to introduce myself, I am the managing partner a company And we are, we support Korn Ferry on various bits and pieces of work over the last five years, and they've asked us to run these interviews so we can be an agnostic third party, so you can speak more freely. So that's it. I mean, any questions before I jump in? Okay, great. Well, thank you for agreeing to do a follow up from the survey that you took, if we could kick off by you starting to just explain your role in the organization and the relationship, the engagement that you've had with Korn Ferry to date. Karina 1 0:56 So my name is Karina. I've been with ExxonMobil for about 27 years, almost been in Baytown, in the manufacturing part of the organization for the last 10 years, and recently, about a year ago, I started working with Korn Ferry on hiring for our senior technical positions in within the manufacturing circuit, which includes five of our US manufacturing sites, Baytown, Beaumont, Baton Rouge, Joliet and a site that we have in Corpus Christi in South Texas. So their support has helped with some of our critical needs in in the technical, engineering, engineering space that we've had as of recently, we've been as a company for this part of the organization. We've been working with Korn Ferry for the past two years on filling some of those, those needs that we have"

Karina 1 2:10 So Korn Ferry is the only third party consulting, or, I'm sorry, hiring agency that we're authorized to work with. So it's the only, yeah, they're the only ones. We're not. We're not working with anyone else."

      "speaker": "Interviewer 2:25",
      "text": "Great. Okay, and so just if you could outline your overall experience, how has it been working with them? Karina 1 2:35 Oh, it's been great. Greg is the lead that we primarily work with. And he has a team of folks that helps us with the various engineering needs that we have. So he has folks on his team that focus on specific engineering disciplines, and then Greg just manages the relationship kind of overall for us, and he keeps a pulse in terms of, like, what our needs are. That's who we work with to establish new left of engagement and stuff like. We also provide the team feedback whenever we need to adjust our searches to to ensure that we're getting in the right candidate pipeline for those open needs that we have."

Karina 1 3:33 No, our internal SME subject matter experts are developing those job descriptions. His team will sometimes expand or ask for, you know, do they usually they'll conduct an intake discussion if they need specific, you know, feedback on like, which skills are more important than others. But we provide those job descriptions"

      "text": "-- 1 of 4 -- Great and in terms of kind of providing you good quality candidates and also your quantity. Do they meet your expectations? Karina 1 4:09 Yeah, for the most part. I mean, I think as a circuit we're all kind of seeing a decline in availability in certain engineering disciplines like electrical engineering, for example. And we see that across the board, even with our direct applicants that apply to our to our job postings. And so it's consistent to what we see. Yeah, they I mean, it also depends on the time of year, right quarter last year, we were clean, and the number of candidates that were coming through. But I think it's due to the fact that, you know, people are usually not looking to change their employment situation at the end of the year, or they're working towards. Like some sort of incident, yeah, a bonus structure with their current employer. So we understand that that could cause, you know, some that it could impact the timing for candidates that are applying to look for positions outside of,"

      "speaker": "Interviewer 5:16",
      "text": "Did you use any of their assessment tools to compare candidate. Karina 1 5:37 No, we did not once they presented candidates to it our panel needs, our ExxonMobil you know, subject matter experts would review their resumes and make decisions on whether they wanted to progress for a phone screen or an on site interview based on those reviews, but we didn't use any of the Korn Ferry tools to do that, okay?"

      "speaker": "Interviewer 6:03",
      "text": "And in terms of things like compensation benchmarking, is that something that you would do already in house, or is that something that Korn Ferry have also helped you with? Karina 1 6:13 We do that in house. We have our own compensation team that that designs our salary workups based on each individual candidate's profile."

      "text": "So in terms of, the end to end experience, from kind of, you know, engaging that Greg and the team on a new role to actually, kind of putting in place and onboarding somebody, How was the experience, in terms of just communication and having that feeling of understanding what's going on. Did you feel informed? Was it at pace and did you feel there was enough energy? Karina 1 6:51 Yes, definitely. I mean Greg scheduled by monthly calls with the team, with our panel lead team, as well as the specific engineering discipline leads that were that that had active needs to the Korn Ferry to give us updates, to share specific, you know, additional context on the candidates that that were coming through and help answer any questions or make any changes to the job descriptions, if needed. So yes, those meetings were taking place and in a consistent on a consistent basis, and the feedback was always ongoing."

      "speaker": "Interviewer 7:30",
      "text": "Is there anything they could have improved on? Karina 1 7:36 Nothing I can think of. I mean, he was throughout the year, Greg and his team were, were always asking for kind of timely feedback, and so there was nothing that was lagging that wasn't immediately addressed"

      "text": "in thinking about an ideal search partner, what are the main things that are the most important for you? If you could build your ideal partner to work with, -- 2 of 4 -- Karina 1 8:10 I would say just you know, communication, receptive to feedback, making sure that the candidates are interested in ExxonMobil and in a career change, or before sending them our way is also really important, so that we can, you know, help our technical group just kind of manage their time and not, you know, waste any, any of our time or the candidate, if they're not really interested in in a career change. So just making sure that the interest is there from the candidate, I think, is, is really important as well. And they were already, you know, testing interest and availability up front, but just continuing to do that, and in doing so with an end goal of really, you know, just helping us see the candidates that that are truly, you know, that know about our employee value proposition, that are open to the geographic locations where we have, you know, open needs to make sure that we're testing that that interest up front, I think, is really important."

Yeah. Karina 1 10:00 I mean, I think it might be a little of both, right? I see the individual partnership and more in my role because, but I'm sure there's a ton of stuff happening in the ground where the first part that you mentioned is also kind of adding value as well."

And Korn Ferry is helping us with those needs accordingly. So just maintaining focus on those critical needs and trying to close those gaps ASAP is really our primary objective this year."
