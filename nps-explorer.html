CompanyA has won the majority of tenders against Spencer Stuart and Heidrick & Struggles. The relationship started with consultant K in Zurich, then transitioned to AC who has been the main contact. Lisa praised CompanyA's tailored approach, thoughtful questions, alignment with PartnerRe's needs, and flexibility in negotiations. AC's communication style matches well with the CEO. There have been some challenges with ongoing US searches involving multiple stakeholders, but overall the experience has been excellent. Lisa is planning to transition out of her role by early next year.",
